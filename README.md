# f-Genetic-Algorithms-for-Path-Planning-in-Grid-Based-Robot-Navigation
Description: This project involves designing and implementing a genetic algorithm to solve the path 
planning problem for a robot in a grid map environment. The robot must navigate from a start 
position (S) to a goal position (G) while avoiding obstacles. Assume that the environment of the 
robot is represented by a grid map in which the initial and goal states (current location and the 
destination) are clearly localized on the map. Some cells of the map contain obstacles the robot 
cannot traverse them to reach the goal. The robot can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally 
from a cell to another neighbor free cell (the maximum number of reachable neighbor cells with one 
transition is 8).
